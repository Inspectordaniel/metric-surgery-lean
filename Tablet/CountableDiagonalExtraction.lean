/-- Countable diagonal extraction: given, for each index `j` and each stage `l`, a sequence
`a j l : ℕ → ℝ` converging as `n → ∞` to a limit `A j` that does NOT depend on `l`, there is a
strictly increasing choice `N : ℕ → ℕ` of stage-`l` cutoffs such that the diagonal sequence
`l ↦ a j l (N l)` converges to `A j` for every `j`. -/
