-- [TABLET NODE: RestrictPiecewiseGeodesic]
/-- Restricting a curve to the window between two breakpoints `s p, s q` of a given geodesic
resolution `(k,s)` yields a piecewise-geodesic curve resolved *by name* by the shifted resolution
`j ↦ s (p + j) - s p` into `q - p` edges: this is the prerequisite `RestrictLSI`'s piecewise-geodesic
conjunct needs (since `IsLSI` has piecewise-geodesicity as its first component), and the named form
is what lets `RestrictDeltaEpsNAtBreakpoints` count the edges of this very resolution. -/
